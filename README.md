# 🪶 Süsi — Discord Art Server Bot

Süsi is a Discord bot integrated with OpenAI, allowing users to interact with advanced AI features directly within their Discord server. The bot uses the **OpenAI Responses API** (model _gpt-4.1_) and includes short conversational memory by incorporating replied messages into context. The project includes configuration for Fly.io and GitHub Workflows, which are used for hosting and automating the deployment of the bot.

## ✨ Features

- Responds **only when the bot is mentioned**.
- Includes reply context:
  - If the replied message is from the bot → marked as `assistant`
  - If it's from a user → marked as `user`
- Sends a **typing indicator** while generating a response.
- Uses the OpenAI Responses API with:
  - Model: `gpt-4.1`
  - Instructions/persona: _“You are an art-server bot named Süsi, answer briefly.”_
- Replies directly to the user in Discord.
